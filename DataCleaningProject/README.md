This is the Solution for the Coursera Course Data Cleaning project... part of the data science speciality.

This project aim is to  demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. as required by the project instruction, a final submission of the following is required:
1. a tidy data set as described below
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Create an R script that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

in this submission you will find:

1. An R script (run.analysis.R) with the code to transform raw data into tidy data
2. CodeBook.md: information of all variables, summaries done and their meaninings
3. README.md : This file which describes the contect of the project submission
